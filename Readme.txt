Give a strong motive to your visitors to share your blog on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus.


== Description ==

Social Share Motivator is a flexible and very efficient plugin that will help you increase the readership of your pages and get something back for all those posts you publish, without charging your visitors. It makes the content of your blog hardly visible (to visitors, not to search engines), urging them to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, if they want full unhindered access. 

Social Share Motivator can be (optionally) very aggressive by not including a "Close" button in the Share prompt, forcing your visitors to "share or leave" (although the Escape key still works). 

After a visitor shares a page, all of your site becomes available, but you can also activate the option of a "Close" button, to let your visitors choose if they prefer to read your blog without sharing at this time.

The plugin simplifies and enhances auto social lock featuring options for custom page titles (letting you define the title of a page that will be shared instead of the currently visited), options to customize the style of the Share prompt (font color, background color, etc), it is compatible with newer versions of WordPress and also with multisite MS / MU installations.

You can also use the Motivator on specific posts and / or pages, for example only on your download page, having the rest of your site easily accessible as always.
