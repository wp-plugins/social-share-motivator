Social Share Motivator makes your page darker, motivating your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, in order to gain access.

== Description ==

Social Share Motivator is a very effective plugin that will help you increase your readership day by day rapidly! It hides the content of your blog, but not entirely, urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, before they are able to enjoy full access.

The plugin can be very aggressive by not including a Close button in the Share prompt, forcing your visitors to "share or leave" (although the Escape key still works). After a visitor shares a page, all of your site becomes available - he won't face a share prompt on another page.

The plugin is based on Auto Social Lock making it more simple. If you need more information, check the [Home Page of Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/).
