Urging your visitors to share your blog on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, to enjoy full access.


== Description ==

Social Share Motivator is a flexible and very effective plugin that will help you increase the popularity of your pages rapidly! It shields your blog (makes the content almost invisible), but not entirely, urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, if they want full access. It can be (optionally) very aggressive by not including a "Close" button in the Share prompt, this way forcing your visitors to "share or leave" (although the Escape key still works). 

After a visitor shares a page, all of your site becomes available, a share prompt won't appear on another page -- and you can also activate the option of a "Close" button, to let them choose if they want to read your blog without sharing at this time.

The plugin simplifies and enhances auto social lock featuring options for custom page titles (letting you define the title of a page that will be shared instead of the currently visited), options to customize the style of the Share prompt (font color, background color, etc), and is compatible with newer versions of WordPress and also with multisite MS / MU installations.
