Social Share Motivator makes your page darker, motivating your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, in order to gain access.

== Description ==

Social Share Motivator makes your page darker (hidden, but not entirely) urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, in order to gain access. 

The plugin can be very aggressive, by not including a Close button (although the Escape key still works). If you are searching for a normal way to let your pages be shared on (even more) social networks, check the [Socializer!](http://www.thefreewindows.com/5598/socializer-share-WordPress-posts-pages/). Social Share Motivator can be annoying since it will "urge" your visitors to share your site.

After a visitor shares your site, all of your site becomes available, he won't face a share prompt each time he opens a new page.

The plugin is based on WeOntech's Auto Social Lock making it more simple. If you need more information, check the [Home Page of Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/).

Except for the screenshot available in these pages, you can also see Social Share Motivator live, e.g. at [Bill Gates Windows](http://www.billgateswindows.com/ms/)
