Social Share Motivator multiplies rapidly the visitors of your blog, urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, if they want to gain full access.

== Description ==

Social Share Motivator is a very effective plugin that will help increase your readership day by day rapidly! It hides the content of your blog, but not entirely, urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, in order for them to enjoy full access to your pages. 

Of course, your blog should already be receiving some visitors, if the plugin is going to multiply them. Publish quality content, and Social Share Motivator will triple (and more) your visitors in no time.

The plugin can be very aggressive by not including a "Close" button in the Share prompt, this way forcing your visitors to "share or leave" (although the Escape key still works). After a visitor shares a page, all of your site becomes available, a share prompt won't appear on another page. 

Social Share Motivator is compatible with multisite MS / MU installations.

The plugin is based on auto social lock making it simple and adding custom page title abilities (letting you define yourself the title of a custom page to be shared instead of the currently visited page's title). If you need more information, you can check the [Home Page of Social Share Motivator](http://www.thefreewindows.com/15816/reveal-posts-visitors-share-social-networks/).

Except for the screenshot available in these pages, you are welcome to see live Social Share Motivator in action, e.g. at [Bill Gates Windows](http://www.billgateswindows.com/ms/) -- Share and see how you gain full access.
