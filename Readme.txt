== Description ==

Social Share Motivator is a flexible and very effective plugin that will help you increase the popularity of your pages rapidly! It shields your blog, but not entirely, urging your visitors to share it on Facebook, Twitter or Google Plus, if they want full unhindered access. 

The plugin can be (optionally) very aggressive by not including a "Close" button in the Share prompt, this way forcing your visitors to "share or leave" (although the Escape key still works). After a visitor shares a page, all of your site becomes available, a share prompt won't appear on another page -- and you can also activate the option of a "Close" button, to let them choose if they want to read your blog without sharing at this time.

Social Share Motivator is compatible with multisite MS / MU installations. It is based on automatic social lock making it simple and adding custom page title abilities (letting you define the title of a custom page that will be shared instead of the currently visited).
